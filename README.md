A project that finds the best property images for user searches.

# Instructions

When users search for properties using specific keywords, they expect to see results
that closely match their interests and intentions. Your challenge is to create a solution
that filters and shows the most similar property images to the user’s search query.

This involves interpreting both the visual content of property images and the textual
information in property descriptions to find the best matches.

Write a script that takes a user’s search keywords as input and returns the top 5
property images that are most similar to the given keywords or a natural language
search. Example search queries: ‘cottage style kitchen’, ‘natural light’, ‘modern bathroom’…

In your solution, consider how to effectively analyse and compare both images and
text descriptions of properties to accurately capture similarity.

Explain the rationale behind the choice of algorithm you selected for this task,
including any considerations for handling images and text.

Discuss the performance metrics you used to evaluate your algorithm’s
effectiveness in identifying similar property images.
